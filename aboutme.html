    <h1> About Me!</h1>
    <p> Hello! My name is Bhagyesh Jethwani and I am a student at the University of Central Florida. I plan to graduate in December 2027 with my BS in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I am a student highly passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, and Full Stack Development. My goal is to one day start my own startup which will involve creating a product entailing skills and features from each of these fields!</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading news about the latest technologies and scientific breakthroughs happening around the world in various fields. I also enjoy playing soccer and pickleball on the weekends as a way to get out and spend time with my friends. </p>
    <p>I also have extraordinary skill in playing chess, and composing beats and music as I have participated in these hobbies competitively since I was a kid.</p>
