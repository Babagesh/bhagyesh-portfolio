                                <p>I am a student highly passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, and Robotics. My goal is to one day start my own startup which will involve creating a product entailing skills and features from each of these fields!</p>

                                            <p>Soccer has been one of my favorite sports since childhood. I enjoy both playing and watching professional matches in stadiums. I often play on weekends with friends at local fields and follow the major leagues during the season. For clubs I am a Liverpool fan and internationally I love how the Brazil team plays although they have been on a decline recently.</p>

                                            <p>Pickleball is a newer passion I've developed during my time at UCF. As a former tennis player, pickleball came easy to me and as a result of the popularity and growth of the sport I started it playing often. I appreciate how accessible it is for players of all skill levels, and the court's smaller size promotes quick reflexes and strategic shot placement, which I find both mentally and physically engaging.</p>

                            <p>In my free time, I also enjoy reading news about the latest technologies and scientific breakthroughs happening around the world in various fields. These activities provide balance to my academic pursuits.</p>
                            
                            <p>I also have extraordinary skill in playing chess, and composing beats and music as I have participated in these hobbies competitively since I was a kid.</p>
